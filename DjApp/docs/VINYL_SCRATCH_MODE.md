# 🎵 Professional Vinyl Scratch Mode

## Overview

MixLab DJ now features a **professional vinyl turntable scratch mode** that simulates real vinyl record control, just like professional DJ equipment (Technics 1200, Pioneer PLX, etc.).

## ✨ Features

### 🎚️ Real-Time Vinyl Control
- **Touch-responsive scratching**: Touch and drag the turntable to scratch
- **Velocity tracking**: Speed of your hand movement affects playback speed
- **Bi-directional scratching**: Scratch forwards and backwards naturally
- **Motor simulation**: Realistic vinyl stop/start effects

### 🎛️ Professional DJ Controls

#### Inner Turntable Area (Vinyl Platter)
- **Drag to scratch**: Click and drag on the turntable surface
- **Velocity-based**: Faster movements = faster scratching
- **Smooth response**: 60fps tracking for ultra-responsive control
- **Automatic stop**: Touching the turntable pauses playback (like holding vinyl)
- **Automatic start**: Releasing resumes playback (like releasing vinyl)

#### Outer Ring (Pitch Control)
- **Vertical drag**: Move up/down to adjust pitch (±8%)
- **Pitch bending**: Fine-tune beatmatching
- **Real-time feedback**: See pitch percentage displayed

## 🎯 How to Use

### Basic Scratching
1. **Load a track** into the deck
2. **Press Play** to start playback
3. **Click and drag** on the turntable inner area
4. **Move your mouse** to create scratch effects
   - **Fast movements** = dramatic scratches
   - **Slow movements** = gentle scrubs
   - **Direction matters** = forwards/backwards

### Advanced Techniques

#### Baby Scratch
- Simple forward and backward motions
- Light, quick movements on the turntable

#### Transformer Scratch
- Quick on-off touches while track plays
- Rapid press-release-press-release

#### Chirp Scratch
- Start slow, accelerate quickly
- Slow drag then fast release

### Pitch Control
1. **Click on the outer ring** of the turntable
2. **Drag up** to increase pitch (+)
3. **Drag down** to decrease pitch (-)
4. **Watch the pitch indicator** at the bottom

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Scratch Sensitivity
- **Default**: 1.5x sensitivity multiplier
- **Range**: -10x to +10x playback speed
- **Smoothing**: 5-frame moving average for natural feel

### Motor Simulation
- **Acceleration**: 0.15 (how fast vinyl speeds up)
- **Deceleration**: 0.30 (how fast vinyl slows down)
- **Target speeds**: 0.0 (stopped) to 1.0 (normal play)

### Velocity Calculation
- **Base vinyl speed**: 200°/sec (simulates 33.3 RPM)
- **Angular tracking**: Real-time angle change monitoring
- **Time delta**: < 1ms precision for accurate velocity

## 🎨 Visual Feedback

### Turntable Indicators
- **Rotating line**: Shows current position in track
- **Pulsing glow**: Indicates active playback
- **Pitch display**: Shows ±% when adjusted
- **Hover effects**: Visual feedback for touch areas

### Ring Colors
- **Inner area** (scratch zone): Dark with grooves
- **Outer ring** (pitch control): Yellow/theme accent
- **Center hub**: Metallic finish with gradient

## 🚀 Performance

### Real-Time Response
- **< 16ms latency**: 60fps scratch tracking
- **Instant feedback**: No audio delay
- **Smooth animation**: Hardware-accelerated rendering

### Optimizations
- Velocity smoothing for natural feel
- Debounced position updates
- Efficient signal/slot connections

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### For Best Results
1. **Use a mouse** for precise control (trackpads work but less precise)
2. **Practice slow** movements first to get the feel
3. **Watch the visual feedback** to understand timing
4. **Experiment with sensitivity** by adjusting scratch speed

### Beatmatching with Vinyl Control
1. Use **pitch ring** to match BPM roughly
2. Use **vinyl scratching** for fine adjustments
3. Use **tempo slider** for precise final matching

### Creative Scratching
- Combine with **EQ controls** for filtered scratches
- Use **loop points** to scratch specific sections
- Try **different speeds** for varied effects

## 🔧 Customization

### Scratch Sensitivity (Developer)
```python
# In turntable.py
turntable.set_scratch_sensitivity(2.0)  # More sensitive
turntable.set_scratch_sensitivity(1.0)  # Less sensitive
```

### Vinyl Mode Toggle (Developer)
```python
# Enable/disable vinyl mode
turntable.set_vinyl_mode(True)   # Vinyl scratching enabled
turntable.set_vinyl_mode(False)  # Standard seek only
```

## 🎓 Professional DJ Techniques

### Vinyl Stop Effect
- Touch the turntable to gradually slow the track
- Creates classic "power-off" effect
- Perfect for dramatic transitions

### Vinyl Start Effect
- Release after touching creates smooth ramp-up
- Natural acceleration like real vinyl motor
- Great for drops and builds

### Pitch Bending
- Use outer ring during beatmatching
- Quick up/down movements to nudge beats
- Essential for maintaining sync
