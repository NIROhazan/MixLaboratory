# Track List Key Display - Bug Fix

## Issue
Keys were not showing in the track list after initial implementation.

## Root Cause
The key detection was working, but keys were **not being saved to persistent cache**. The analysis thread was:
1. ✅ Detecting keys correctly
2. ✅ Emitting signals to update UI
3. ❌ **NOT saving keys to cache_manager**

This meant:
- Keys appeared during analysis (if you watched in real-time)
- Keys disappeared on app restart
- Keys didn't load from cache on subsequent folder opens

## Fix Applied

### 1. Pass cache_manager to BPMAnalyzerThread

**Before:**
```python
self.analyzer_thread = BPMAnalyzerThread(
    self.audio_analyzer, 
    self.directory, 
    files_to_analyze
)
```

**After:**
```python
self.analyzer_thread = BPMAnalyzerThread(
    self.audio_analyzer, 
    self.directory, 
    files_to_analyze,
    self.cache_manager  # Pass cache_manager for key persistence
)
```

### 2. Cache key data after detection

**In BPMAnalyzerThread.run():**
```python
# Detect musical key
try:
    key, confidence = self.audio_analyzer.detect_key(file_path)
    if key:
        print(f"🎹 Key: {file} - {key} ({confidence:.0%} confidence)")
        
        # Cache the key data for future use
        if self.cache_manager:
            self.cache_manager.cache_key_data(file_path, key, confidence)
        
        # Emit key signal
        self.key_analyzed.emit(file, key, confidence)
except Exception as key_error:
    print(f"⚠️  Key detection failed for {file}: {key_error}")
```

### 3. Enable HTML rendering for metadata label

```python
metadata_label.setTextFormat(Qt.TextFormat.RichText)  # Enable HTML rendering
```

This ensures color-coded confidence indicators display properly.

## Testing

1. **Delete the cache directory** to start fresh:
   ```bash
   rm -rf DjApp/cache/keys/
   ```

2. **Restart the app** and open track list

3. **Watch the console** for key detection messages:
   ```
   🎹 Key: track.mp3 - C Major (8B) (85% confidence)
   ```

4. **Verify display** shows:
   ```
   Track Name
   🎵 128 BPM | 🎹 C Major ✓
   [Load Deck 1] [Load Deck 2]
   ```

5. **Close and reopen** track list - keys should load instantly from cache

## Files Modified

1. **`file_management.py`**
   - Added `cache_manager` parameter to `BPMAnalyzerThread.__init__`
   - Added `self.cache_manager.cache_key_data()` call after key detection
   - Passed `cache_manager` when creating analyzer thread
   - Enabled `RichText` format for metadata label

2. **`cache_manager.py`** (already had these methods)
   - `cache_key_data()` - Save key to persistent storage
   - `get_key_data()` - Retrieve cached key

---

## How It Works Now

### On First Analysis:
1. User opens track list
2. Thread detects BPM and Key for each track
3. **Key saved to `cache/keys/{hash}.json`**
4. Key displayed in UI with confidence color

### On Subsequent Opens:
1. User opens track list
2. System loads keys from `cache/keys/` instantly
3. Keys displayed immediately (no re-analysis)
4. Thread only analyzes new/uncached tracks

## Cache Structure

```
cache/
├── bpm/
│   └── {hash}.json          # BPM and beat positions
├── keys/
│   └── {hash}.json          # Musical key data
├── waveforms/
│   └── {hash}.npz           # Waveform data
└── cache_metadata.json      # File integrity tracking
```

**Key file format:**
```json
{
  "key": "C Major (8B)",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "cached_at": 1730428800.123
}
```

---

## Performance Impact

- **First analysis**: +5-10 seconds per track (key detection)
- **Cached loads**: Instant (read from JSON file)
- **Disk usage**: ~100 bytes per track (JSON)

---

## Color Coding

The metadata label uses HTML/CSS for color-coded confidence:

| Indicator | Color | HTML | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|------|------------|
| ✓ | Green | `#00ff00` | >70% |
| ~ | Yellow | `#ffff00` | 50-70% |
| ? | Orange | `#ff6600` | <50% |

**Example HTML:**
```html
🎵 128 BPM | 🎹 <span style="color: #00ff00;">C Major ✓</span>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Keys still not showing?

1. **Check console output** - Look for key detection messages
2. **Verify librosa is installed**:
   ```bash
   pip install librosa
   ```
3. **Check cache directory** exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la DjApp/cache/keys/
   ```
4. **Try a test track** with strong harmonic content (not percussion-heavy)

### Low confidence scores?

- Harmonic tracks (piano, synth) work best
- Percussive tracks (drums only) may fail
- Short tracks (<30s) less reliable
- Atonal/ambient music may have low confidence

**Status: ✅ FIXED**

Keys now properly display in track list with persistent caching!
