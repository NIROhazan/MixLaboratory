## 🎵 **NEW: Professional Vinyl Scratch Mode**

### What It Does
Transform your turntable into a professional vinyl controller! Just like real DJ equipment (Technics 1200, Pioneer PLX), you can now:

- **Touch and drag** the turntable to scratch tracks
- **Velocity-based control** - your hand speed affects playback speed
- **Bi-directional scratching** - scratch forwards and backwards naturally
- **Realistic vinyl stop/start** effects when touching and releasing

### How to Use
1. Load a track and press play
2. Click and drag on the turntable inner area
3. Move fast for dramatic scratches, slow for gentle scrubs
4. Use the outer ring for pitch control (±8%)

### Professional Features
- **Real-time velocity tracking** at 60fps
- **Smooth playback rate adjustment** with no audio delay
- **Motor simulation** for authentic vinyl feel
- **Adjustable sensitivity** for your preferred control style
