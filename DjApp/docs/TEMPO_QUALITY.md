# 🎵 MixLab DJ - Tempo Change Quality Guide

## Overview

MixLab DJ uses **professional-grade tempo changing** with **key lock** (pitch preservation) to maintain audio quality during BPM changes. No more "chipmunk effect" or audio artifacts!

---

## 🔬 What is Key Lock?

### The Problem Without Key Lock

When you speed up audio normally:
- 🐿️ **Chipmunk effect** - voices sound higher pitched
- 🎼 **Wrong key** - music shifts out of tune
- 🎵 **Unusable for DJs** - can't mix tracks properly

### The Solution: Phase Vocoder with Key Lock

**Key Lock** (also called "pitch preservation" or "master tempo"):
- ✅ Changes **tempo** (speed) without changing **pitch** (key)
- ✅ Maintains **harmonic structure** of music
- ✅ Keeps songs **in their original key**
- ✅ Allows **±50% tempo range** with good quality

## 🎛️ Technology Stack

### 1. **Rubber Band Library** (Best Quality) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Algorithm:** Advanced phase vocoder with transient detection

**Used By:**
- Ableton Live
- Pro Tools
- Audacity
- Ardour
- Most professional DAWs

**How It Works:**
1. Analyzes audio for **transients** (drum hits, attacks)
2. Applies **phase vocoder** to harmonic content
3. Preserves **transients** separately for clarity
4. **Crossfades** between segments smoothly
5. Result: Professional DAW-quality stretching

**Quality Features:**
- ✅ Excellent transient preservation (drums stay punchy)
- ✅ Minimal artifacts even at extreme stretches (±50%)
- ✅ Formant preservation (vocals sound natural)
- ✅ Multi-algorithm selection (crisp, smooth, mixed)

**Performance:**
- Speed: Moderate (2-5x real-time)
- CPU: Medium
- Quality: Industry standard

**Installation:**
```bash
# System library required
# Windows: Download from https://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/
# Linux: sudo apt install rubberband-cli librubberband-dev
# macOS: brew install rubberband

# Python wrapper
pip install pyrubberband
```

**How It Works:**
1. Split audio into small **grains** (overlapping segments)
2. Repeat or skip grains to change tempo
3. **Crossfade** between grains to avoid clicks
4. Limited pitch correction

**Quality Features:**
- ⚠️ Basic pitch preservation
- ⚠️ Some artifacts at extreme stretches
- ✅ Very fast (10-20x real-time)
- ✅ No dependencies required

**Performance:**

- CPU: Very low
- Quality: Basic (usable for quick changes)

**Use Case:** Fallback when other engines unavailable

---

## 🎚️ Automatic Engine Selection

MixLab DJ **automatically** chooses the best available engine:

```python
Priority:
1. Rubber Band (if installed) → Best quality
2. librosa (always available) → Good quality
3. Native FFT (fallback) → Basic quality
```

**No configuration needed!** The system uses the best tool available.

## 🔬 Phase Vocoder Explained (Technical)

### What is a Phase Vocoder?

A **phase vocoder** is a signal processing technique that allows independent control of pitch and tempo.

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

#### 1. **Analysis Phase**
```
Original Audio
     ↓
Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
     ↓
Frequency-domain representation
(magnitude + phase for each frequency bin)
```

#### 2. **Modification Phase**
```
For each frequency bin:
  - Keep magnitude (amplitude) unchanged
  - Adjust phase to maintain continuity
  - Time-stretch by changing hop size
  
Result: New timing, same frequencies
```

#### 3. **Synthesis Phase**
```
Modified STFT
     ↓
Inverse STFT
     ↓
Overlap-Add reconstruction
     ↓
Time-stretched audio (pitch preserved!)
```

### Key Concepts

**STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform):**
- Splits audio into short windows (e.g., 2048 samples)
- Analyzes frequency content of each window
- Maintains time-frequency resolution

**Phase Locking:**
- Maintains phase relationships between consecutive frames
- Prevents "phasiness" artifacts
- Critical for pitch preservation

**Overlap-Add (OLA):**
- Reconstructs audio from overlapping windows
- Smooth transitions between frames
- Windowing function prevents clicks

## ⚙️ Advanced Settings

### Customizing Quality vs Speed

Edit `tempo_shifter.py` for advanced control:

```python
# Force specific engine
success = tempo_shifter.change_tempo(
    input_file="track.mp3",
    output_file="stretched.mp3",
    stretch_factor=1.1,
    engine="rubberband",  # Force best quality
    preserve_pitch=True
)

# Engines: "rubberband", "librosa", "native", "auto"
```

### Rubber Band Options (if using directly)

```python
import pyrubberband as pyrb

# Crisp mode (better for drums)
y_stretched = pyrb.time_stretch(y, sr, rate, rbargs={
    '--crisp': '6'  # 0-6, higher = more transient preservation
})

# Smooth mode (better for vocals)
y_stretched = pyrb.time_stretch(y, sr, rate, rbargs={
    '--formant': True  # Preserve vocal formants
})
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Best Quality

1. **Install Rubber Band**
   - Significant quality improvement
   - Worth the installation effort

2. **Minimize BPM Changes**
   - Keep within ±15% when possible
   - Use original track BPM as reference

3. **Pre-process Large Changes**
   - For extreme changes (>20%), process once and save
   - Don't repeatedly stretch same track

4. **Use High-Quality Sources**
   - WAV/FLAC better than MP3
   - Higher bitrate = better results

### For Best Performance

1. **librosa is Fast Enough**
   - Good balance of quality and speed
   - Works great for live DJ use

2. **Cache Processed Files**
   - MixLab DJ automatically caches
   - Subsequent loads are instant

3. **Close Other Apps**
   - More CPU for audio processing
   - Smoother real-time operation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quality Issues

### Problem: "Chipmunk Effect" (Pitch Changed)

**Cause:** Key lock not working

**Solution:**
```python
# Ensure preserve_pitch=True
preserve_pitch=True  # This enables key lock
```

### Problem: Robotic/Metallic Sound

**Cause:** Phase vocoder artifacts (extreme stretch)

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce stretch amount (stay within ±15%)
2. Install Rubber Band for better algorithm
3. Use original track BPM closer to target

### Problem: Transients Sound Smeared (Drums Lose Punch)

**Cause:** Phase vocoder smoothing transients

**Solutions:**
1. Install Rubber Band (best transient preservation)
2. Reduce window size (advanced users)
3. Accept minor quality loss for extreme changes

### Problem: Slow Processing Time

**Cause:** Rubber Band is slower

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for processing (one-time cost)
2. Use librosa for faster processing
3. Cache processed files (automatic in MixLab DJ)
