# Install Python 3.14
pyenv install 3.14.0
pyenv local 3.14.0

# Try installing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If packages fail, try:
pip install --only-binary :none: numpy scipy  # Compile from source
pip install --pre librosa  # Try pre-release versions
```

## Migration Guide

### From Python 3.10 → 3.12
```bash
# 1. Backup your environment
pip freeze > old_requirements.txt

# 2. Install Python 3.12
# (see installation instructions above)

# 3. Create new virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# 4. Install MixLab DJ
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Test
python version_check.py
```

### From Python 3.12 → 3.14
```bash
# 1. Only do this if you want to test cutting-edge!
python --version  # Verify you have 3.14

# 2. Create isolated environment
python3.14 -m venv venv-314

# 3. Try installing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. If packages fail, wait for wheels or compile:
pip install --only-binary :none: problematic-package

# 5. Report issues to help the community!
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No matching distribution found for numpy>=1.26.0"

**Cause:** Python 3.14 too new, no pre-built wheels yet

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait** for package updates (recommended)
2. **Downgrade** to Python 3.12:
   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.12.0
   pyenv local 3.12.0
   ```
3. **Compile from source** (advanced):
   ```bash
   pip install --no-binary :all: numpy
   ```

### "ImportError: DLL load failed" (Windows)

**Cause:** Missing Visual C++ redistributables for compiled packages

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Visual C++ Redistributables
# Download from: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
```

### "Segmentation fault" with Python 3.14

**Cause:** Package not fully compatible with 3.14 yet

**Solution:**
```bash
# Downgrade to Python 3.12
pyenv install 3.12.5
pyenv local 3.12.5
```

python -c "import sys; print(f'Python {sys.version}')"

# Check if JIT is available (3.13+)
python -c "import sys; print('JIT available' if hasattr(sys, 'set_int_max_str_digits') else 'No JIT')"

# Run MixLab DJ version checker
cd DjApp
python version_check.py
```

## Conclusion

### TL;DR Recommendations:

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Most Stable** | Python 3.12 |
| **Best Performance (stable)** | Python 3.12 |
| **Experimental Performance** | Python 3.13 + JIT |
| **Cutting Edge Testing** | Python 3.14 |

## Getting Help

**Version-specific issues:**
- Python 3.12 issues → Check INSTALLATION.md
- Python 3.13 issues → Check Python 3.13 release notes
- Python 3.14 issues → Wait for package ecosystem to catch up or use 3.12

**Performance issues:**
- Run benchmarks: `python -m timeit "import numpy as np; a = np.random.rand(1000,1000); b = a @ a"`
- Check CPU usage in Task Manager/Activity Monitor
- Enable JIT if using 3.13+: `python -X jit djapp.py`
