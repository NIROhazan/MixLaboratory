# 🎵 MixLab DJ - New Features & Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes all new features and performance improvements added to MixLab DJ, transforming it into a professional-grade DJ application with AI-powered mixing capabilities.

---

## 🎹 1. Musical Key Detection & Harmonic Mixing

### What's New

- **Automatic Key Detection**: Uses librosa with Krumhansl-Schmuckler key profiles to detect musical keys
- **Camelot Wheel Notation**: Industry-standard DJ notation (1A-12B) for harmonic mixing
- **Real-time Key Display**: Shows detected key with confidence level color-coding:
  - 🟢 Green: High confidence (>70%)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Medium confidence (50-70%)
  - 🟠 Orange: Low confidence (<50%)

### How It Works

```python
# Key detection happens automatically when loading tracks
detected_key, confidence = audio_analyzer.detect_key(file_path)
# Example output: "C Major (8B)", 0.85
```

### Key Features

- Cached results for instant lookup
- Compatible keys shown using Camelot wheel rules
- Helps DJs mix tracks that sound good together

---

## 🎚️ 2. Key Transposition Controls

### What's New

- **Semitone Shifting**: Transpose tracks up/down by semitones
- **Visual Key Display**: Shows current key and transposition amount
- **Limits**: ±12 semitones (1 octave) to preserve audio quality

### UI Controls

- **♭ Button**: Transpose down 1 semitone
- **♯ Button**: Transpose up 1 semitone
- **Reset Key**: Return to original key

### Display Format

```
Original: C Major (8B)
Transposed +2: D Major (8B) +2st
```

**Note**: Currently displays transposed key for DJ reference. Real-time pitch shifting can be enabled with pyrubberband library.

## 🤖 3. AI-Powered Auto-Mix System

### What's New

The most powerful feature - intelligent playlist generation using AI algorithms!

#### 3.1 Intelligent Track Matching

- **BPM Compatibility**: Matches tracks within ±6% BPM (ideal) or ±10% (acceptable)
- **Harmonic Compatibility**: Uses Camelot wheel rules for smooth key transitions
- **Energy Matching**: Considers track energy levels based on BPM

#### 3.2 Compatibility Scoring Algorithm

```python
score = (BPM_compatibility × 50%) + (Harmonic_match × 40%) + (Energy_match × 10%)
```

**Scoring Breakdown**:

- **BPM** (50% weight):

  - ±6% difference: Perfect (1.0)
  - ±10% difference: Good (0.7-1.0)
  - ±15% difference: Workable (0.0-0.4)
  - > 15% difference: Poor (0.0)

- **Harmonic** (40% weight):

  - Same key: Perfect (1.0)
  - Compatible key (Camelot wheel): Excellent (0.9)
  - Non-compatible: Poor (0.2)

- **Energy** (10% weight):
  - Similar BPM: Best (1.0)
  - ±10 BPM difference: Good (0.5)
  - > 20 BPM difference: Poor (0.0)

#### 3.3 Playlist Generation Strategies

**1. Optimal (Best Matches)**

- Finds best overall compatibility between consecutive tracks
- Balanced mix of BPM and harmonic matching
- **Use for**: General DJ sets, safe transitions

**2. Energy Up (Build Up)**

- Gradually increases BPM throughout the set
- Creates excitement and builds energy
- **Use for**: Opening sets, peak-time buildups

**3. Energy Down (Wind Down)**

- Creates smooth, relaxing progression
- **Use for**: Closing sets, chill-out sessions

**4. Key Journey (Harmonic Flow)**

- Strong focus on harmonic compatibility
- Smooth musical progressions
- **Use for**: Melodic sets, musical storytelling

#### 3.4 Auto-Mix Dialog Features

- **Folder Analysis**: Analyzes entire music folders with progress tracking
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows which track is being analyzed
- **Playlist Review**: Visual preview with compatibility scores
- **Compatibility Report**: Detailed analysis of track-to-track transitions
- **Configurable Settings**:
  - Playlist length (2-100 tracks)
  - Crossfade duration (5-60 seconds)
  - Mix strategy selection

#### 3.5 Automatic Crossfading

- **Smart Transition Timing**: Starts crossfade based on configured duration
- **Volume Curve**: Smooth logarithmic fade between tracks
- **Auto-Loading**: Automatically loads next track into free deck
- **Continuous Playback**: Seamless transitions throughout playlist

### Using Auto-Mix

**Step 1**: Click **"AutoMix"** button in main app

**Step 2**: Select music folder and click **"Analyze Tracks"**

- Shows progress: "Analyzing: track.mp3 (5/20)"
- Detects BPM and key for each track

**Step 3**: Configure playlist

- Choose strategy (Optimal, Energy Up, Energy Down, Key Journey)
- Set number of tracks (2-100)
- Set crossfade duration (5-60 seconds)

**Step 4**: Click **"Generate Playlist"**

- AI analyzes all tracks
- Creates optimized playlist
- Shows compatibility scores

**Step 5**: Review playlist

- Green ✓✓ (80%+): Excellent transition
- Yellow ✓ (60-80%): Good transition
- Orange ⚠ (<60%): Acceptable transition

**Step 6**: Click **"Load Playlist"**

- First track loads into Deck 1
- Second track loads into Deck 2
- Auto-mix begins!

### Auto-Mix Benefits
