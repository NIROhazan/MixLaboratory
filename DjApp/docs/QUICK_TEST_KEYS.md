# Quick Test: Key Display in Track List

## Issue Fixed
✅ Keys were not showing because they **weren't being saved to cache**

## What Was Wrong
1. ❌ BPMAnalyzerThread detected keys
2. ❌ Keys emitted via signal (temporary display only)
3. ❌ **Keys NOT saved to cache_manager**
4. ❌ Keys disappeared on app restart

## What's Fixed Now
1. ✅ BPMAnalyzerThread has `cache_manager` parameter
2. ✅ Keys saved to `cache/keys/{hash}.json` after detection
3. ✅ Keys load instantly from cache on subsequent opens
4. ✅ HTML/RichText enabled for color-coded confidence

## Test Steps

### 1. Open Track List
```
Click "🎵 Show Track List" after selecting audio directory
```

### 2. Watch Console Output
You should see:
```
✅ BPM: track.mp3 - 128 BPM, 450 beats
🎹 Key: track.mp3 - C Major (8B) (85% confidence)
```

### 3. Check Track List Display
Each track should show:
```
Track Name
🎵 128 BPM | 🎹 C Major ✓
[Load Deck 1] [Load Deck 2]
```

**Confidence Colors:**
- ✓ (Green) = >70% confidence
- ~ (Yellow) = 50-70% confidence
- ? (Orange) = <50% confidence

### 4. Verify Caching
Close and reopen track list - keys should appear **instantly** (no re-analysis)

Check cache directory:
```bash
dir DjApp\cache\keys\
```

You should see `.json` files with key data.

## If Keys Still Don't Show

### Check librosa installation:
```bash
cd DjApp
python -c "import librosa; print('librosa OK')"
```

### Check audio_analyzer_bridge:
```bash
python -c "from audio_analyzer_bridge import AudioAnalyzerBridge; a = AudioAnalyzerBridge(); print('Has detect_key:', hasattr(a, 'detect_key'))"
```

### Clear cache and restart:
```bash
rmdir /s DjApp\cache\keys
```

## Expected Behavior

### First Time Opening Folder:
- 📊 BPM detection: ~1-2 seconds per track
- 🎹 Key detection: ~5-10 seconds per track
- 💾 Both saved to cache
- 📺 Display updates progressively

### Subsequent Opens:
- ⚡ Instant load from cache
- 📺 All tracks show BPM + Key immediately
- 🎯 No re-analysis needed

**Status: ✅ READY TO TEST**

Open the app, select a music folder, and click "Show Track List"!
