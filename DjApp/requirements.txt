# MixLab DJ - Python Dependencies
# Requires Python 3.11+ (recommended: Python 3.12 for best stability)
# Python 3.11+ provides significant speed improvements (10-60% faster)
#
# VERSION COMPATIBILITY:
# ✅ Python 3.11 - Stable, well-tested, fast
# ✅ Python 3.12 - RECOMMENDED - Most stable, best package support
# ⚠️ Python 3.13 - Experimental JIT, may have limited package support
# 🔬 Python 3.14 - Cutting-edge, use for testing only (October 2025 release)
#
# For production use: Python 3.12 is recommended
# For experimentation: Python 3.13 or 3.14 (ensure all packages have wheels)
